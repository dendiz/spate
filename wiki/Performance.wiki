#summary Performance metrics

= Introduction =
Performance metrics of the simulation engine through out its evaluation. To evaluate the Botpit simulation engine in a fair way only the bots of types CallBot which only return a call or check action every time without doing any calculations (0.000025ms) were included in the game.
The number of bots included in the game effect performance (due to more hand rank lookups,etc.) so the number of players in the simulation are included with the results.


= Details =
In all simulations the application logging is disabled. Trace logging is enabled when indicated. Even though Spate uses an array buffer to hold 30K entries and dumps them in batch using a buffered output writer, the impact is still high on performance.
