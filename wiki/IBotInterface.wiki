Here are the descriptions of the methods:

*public int get_seat();*
Return the seat number that this bot has been assigned to.

*public void new_hand();*
This method is called when a new hand is beginning.

*public String get_name();*
This method returns the name of the bot.

*public void game_start();*
This method is called by the simulation engine at the start of the simulation.

*public void hole_cards(String c1, String c2);*
This method is called by the simulation engine during the preflop stage when the hole cards are dealt. The cards are represented as "ranksuit" where rank is one of [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K,A] and suit is one of [c,d,s,h]. For example "2c" would represent the card the two of clubs and "Kd" would be the king of diamonds.

*public String[] get_cards();*
This method returns the hole cards of the bot.


*public Action get_action();*
This method returns the action for the bot.

*public void player_action(Action ac);*
This method is called by the simulation engine to inform the bot of the action of another bot.
